      <h3> Ivy Boiko - Physics Undergraduate Student!</h3>
      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
         I'm a third year undergraduate student at Cal State Long Beach majoring in physics. 
         Prior to transferring to CSU Long Beach, I attended Monterey Peninsula College. 
         During my time in Monterey, I volunteered and interned at the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy.
      </p>
      <p>
         When I'm not hunched over homework, I enjoy photography (film or digital, but preferably film), 
         finding new electronic artists to listen to, and binging 90s anime.
