      <h3> Ivy Boiko - Physics Undergraduate Student!</h3>
      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
         I'm a third year undergraduate student at Cal State Long Beach majoring in physics.
         After obtaining my bachelor's degree in physics, I hope to pursue a PhD in astrophysics and a career as an astronomer.
         Prior to transferring to CSU Long Beach, I attended Monterey Peninsula College. 
         During my time in Monterey, I volunteered and interned at the <a href="https://www.mira.org/">Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         When I'm not hunched over homework, I enjoy photography (film or digital, but preferably film), 
         finding new electronic artists to listen to, and binging 90s anime.
      </p>
